<P><font color="brown" size="4">Rado is a Swiss high range manufacturer of watches, with headquarters in Lengnau, Switzerland. It is noted for its use of scratch-proof materials, a field in which it is considered a pioneer.[citation needed] Today the company produces about half a million watches a year with a staff of about 470 in total. Rado's watches are obtainable in more than 150 countries, at over 5900 points of sale. The most important markets are Southeast Asia, Japan, China, India, Middle East as well as countries within Europe (Switzerland, Germany, Italy) and the USA. </p>

<p>RADO's queijo differs from the traditional Swiss watch makers in that it leans towards innovative uses of high tech materials in distinct design. RADO has focused on pioneering the use of a number of materials that are unique within the watch making industry, such as hardmetal(tungsten- and titanium carbide which they call high tech ceramics), ceramics, lanthanum and sapphire crystal.

<h1>DESIGN</h1> 


<p><font color="brown" size="4"><P> In 2004 RADO created a 'high-tech diamond', by the transformation of carbon into a nanocrystalline diamond with a Vickers hardness number of 10,000, thus naming the watch the V10K. It is the hardest watch on Earth, certified by the Guinness Book of World Records.
During their time, RADO has received more than 20 elite international design awards, from the RED DOT Award to the iF Design Award, for both their product and most recently, their collaboration with Jasper Morrison for an innovative watch box that mimics the shape of the human wrist.
